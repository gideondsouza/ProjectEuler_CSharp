This is a simple little set of solutions to the problems on ProjectEuler : [http://projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net)

There's a little bit of a framework, implement a problem by Inheriting IProblem, reference this in the main and it'll run. It also records the milliseconds elapsed.

Do give me a buzz if you find errors or mistakes or improvements :)
